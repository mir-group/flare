   \section{\label{sec:level1}Introduction}
   
   This sample document demonstrates proper use of REV\TeX~4.1 (and
   \LaTeXe) in mansucripts prepared for submission to APS
   journals. Further information can be found in the REV\TeX~4.1
   documentation included in the distribution or available at
   \url{http://authors.aps.org/revtex4/}.
   
   When commands are referred to in this example file, they are always
   shown with their required arguments, using normal \TeX{} format. In
   this format, \verb+#1+, \verb+#2+, etc. stand for required
   author-supplied arguments to commands. For example, in
   \verb+\section{#1}+ the \verb+#1+ stands for the title text of the
   author's section heading, and in \verb+\title{#1}+ the \verb+#1+
   stands for the title text of the paper.
   
   Line breaks in section headings at all levels can be introduced using
   \textbackslash\textbackslash. A blank input line tells \TeX\ that the
   paragraph has ended. Note that top-level section headings are
   automatically uppercased. If a specific letter or word should appear in
   lowercase instead, you must escape it using \verb+\lowercase{#1}+ as
   in the word ``via'' above.
   
   \subsection{\label{sec:level2}Second-level heading: Formatting}
   
   This file may be formatted in either the \texttt{preprint} or
   \texttt{reprint} style. \texttt{reprint} format mimics final journal output. 
   Either format may be used for submission purposes. \texttt{letter} sized paper should
   be used when submitting to APS journals.
   
   \subsubsection{Wide text (A level-3 head)}
   The \texttt{widetext} environment will make the text the width of the
   full page, as on page~\pageref{eq:wideeq}. (Note the use the
   \verb+\pageref{#1}+ command to refer to the page number.) 
   \paragraph{Note (Fourth-level head is run in)}
   The width-changing commands only take effect in two-column formatting. 
   There is no effect if text is in a single column.
   
   \subsection{\label{sec:citeref}Citations and References}
   A citation in text uses the command \verb+\cite{#1}+ or
   \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+ and refers to an entry in the bibliography. 
   An entry in the bibliography is a reference to another document.
   
   \subsubsection{Citations}
   Because REV\TeX\ uses the \verb+natbib+ package of Patrick Daly, 
   the entire repertoire of commands in that package are available for your document;
   see the \verb+natbib+ documentation for further details. Please note that
   REV\TeX\ requires version 8.31a or later of \verb+natbib+.
   
   \paragraph{Syntax}
   The argument of \verb+\cite+ may be a single \emph{key}, 
   or may consist of a comma-separated list of keys.
   The citation \emph{key} may contain 
   letters, numbers, the dash (-) character, or the period (.) character. 
   New with natbib 8.3 is an extension to the syntax that allows for 
   a star (*) form and two optional arguments on the citation key itself.
   The syntax of the \verb+\cite+ command is thus (informally stated)
   \begin{quotation}\flushleft\leftskip1em
   \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{key} \verb+}+, or\\
   \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{optarg+key} \verb+}+, or\\
   \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{optarg+key} \verb+,+ \emph{optarg+key}\ldots \verb+}+,
   \end{quotation}\noindent
   where \emph{optarg+key} signifies 
   \begin{quotation}\flushleft\leftskip1em
   \emph{key}, or\\
   \texttt{*}\emph{key}, or\\
   \texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\emph{key}, or\\
   \texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\texttt{[}\emph{post}\texttt{]}\emph{key}, or even\\
   \texttt{*}\texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\texttt{[}\emph{post}\texttt{]}\emph{key}.
   \end{quotation}\noindent
   where \emph{pre} and \emph{post} is whatever text you wish to place 
   at the beginning and end, respectively, of the bibliographic reference
   (see Ref.~[\onlinecite{witten2001}] and the two under Ref.~[\onlinecite{feyn54}]).
   (Keep in mind that no automatic space or punctuation is applied.)
   It is highly recommended that you put the entire \emph{pre} or \emph{post} portion 
   within its own set of braces, for example: 
   \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \texttt{[} \verb+{+\emph{text}\verb+}+\texttt{]}\emph{key}\verb+}+.
   The extra set of braces will keep \LaTeX\ out of trouble if your \emph{text} contains the comma (,) character.
   
   The star (*) modifier to the \emph{key} signifies that the reference is to be 
   merged with the previous reference into a single bibliographic entry, 
   a common idiom in APS and AIP articles (see below, Ref.~[\onlinecite{epr}]). 
   When references are merged in this way, they are separated by a semicolon instead of 
   the period (full stop) that would otherwise appear.
   
   \paragraph{Eliding repeated information}
   When a reference is merged, some of its fields may be elided: for example, 
   when the author matches that of the previous reference, it is omitted. 
   If both author and journal match, both are omitted.
   If the journal matches, but the author does not, the journal is replaced by \emph{ibid.},
   as exemplified by Ref.~[\onlinecite{epr}]. 
   These rules embody common editorial practice in APS and AIP journals and will only
   be in effect if the markup features of the APS and AIP Bib\TeX\ styles is employed.
   
   \paragraph{The options of the cite command itself}
   Please note that optional arguments to the \emph{key} change the reference in the bibliography, 
   not the citation in the body of the document. 
   For the latter, use the optional arguments of the \verb+\cite+ command itself:
   \verb+\cite+ \texttt{*}\allowbreak
   \texttt{[}\emph{pre-cite}\texttt{]}\allowbreak
   \texttt{[}\emph{post-cite}\texttt{]}\allowbreak
   \verb+{+\emph{key-list}\verb+}+.
