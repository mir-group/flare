ASE Interface
=============

We provide an interface to do the OTF training coupling with ASE. 
Including wrapping the FLARE's GaussianProcess and MappedGaussianProcess into an ASE calculator: :class:`FLARE_Calculator`,
the on-the-fly training module coupled with ASE molecular dynamics engines :module:`otf_md.py`
